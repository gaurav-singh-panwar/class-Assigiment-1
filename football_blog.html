    margin: 10px;">Jamie O’Hara believes League Two and the National League should ‘MERGE’ after the coronavirus crisis to save lower league football.

        The Billericay Town boss claims the foot of the EFL and top of non-league should combine and be split into North and South Divisions.He believes it would not only keep travel costs down, but would also help clubs invest more money into their squads and encourage more local fans to watch live matches.

        The English Football League is at a standstill, with clubs still waiting for official word on the future of the 2019/20 campaign.
        
        While Championship and League One side are keen to play to a conclusion, the League Two season looks likely to be shelved.
        
        The EFL have today insisted promotion and relegation must remain in place, while an unweighted points per game system will be used to determine final tables if seasons are cut short.
