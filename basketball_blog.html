    margin: 10px;">Michael Jordan's entire story is too long to fit into any documentary. As detailed as "The Last Dance" is on most of the important moments of his career, it would be unrealistic to expect every worthwhile element of his legacy into 10 hours. Cuts had to be made for the sake of narrative consistency, time and approval from the parties involved. 

        But just because certain stories didn't make it into "The Last Dance" doesn't mean they aren't worth telling. Quite the contrary. Some of the most fascinating parts of Jordan's legendary career missed the cut, but still deserve to be heard. And so, below are the best Michael Jordan stories that didn't make it into his 10-part documentary. </p>
